# What is Cargo Lambda?

Cargo Lambda is a subcommand for [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), the Rust package manager, to work with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

Cargo Lambda provides tools and workflows to help you get started building Rust functions for AWS Lambda from scratch. When you're ready to put your work in production, Cargo Lambda helps you build and deploy your functions on AWS Lambda in an efficient manner.
