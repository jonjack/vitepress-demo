# Lambda Extensions

AWS Lambda Extensions are sidecar services that can provide extra capabilities to your functions.

Cargo Lambda can also help you build and deploy Lambda Extensions. If you want to learn how to run extensions locally and connect them to the local runtime, check the  watch documentation.
## Step 1: Create a new project

To start a new extension project, use with `new` subcommand with the `--extension` flag:

```sh
cargo lambda new --extension extension-project
```

::: tip
Add the `--logs` flag if your extension in a Logs extension, or the `--telemetry` flag if you want to process Lambda telemetry data.
:::

## Step 2: Build your extension

Once you're ready to compile your project, use the `build` subcommand with the `--extension` flag:

```sh
cargo lambda build --extension
```

## Step 3: Deploy your extension

Lambda extensions are deployed as layers for functions to consume. Use the `deploy` subcommand with the `--extension` flag to upload the extension layer to AWS. When this command completes, it will print the full ARN to use to attach this extension to a function:

```sh
cargo lambda deploy --extension
```

## Step 4: Associate your extension to a function

If you already have a function project  that you want to attach your extension to, you can use the same `deploy` subcommand to do so. Go to the root directory for your function's project, and add the `--layer-arn` flag with the extension ARN that the previous command printed in the terminal:

```sh
cargo lambda deploy --layer-arn EXTENSION_ARN
```
